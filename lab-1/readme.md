## Overview

In this Lab, ML models are exposed as APIs using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/).
1. **FastAPI**: FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.
2. **uvicorn**: Uvicorn is an [Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface - ASGI](https://youtu.be/vKjCkeJGbNk) web server implementation for Python. It is often used to serve FastAPI aplications.

The workflow involves the following steps:
1. Training a Decision Tree Classifier.
2. Serving the trained model as an API using FastAPI and uvicorn.
